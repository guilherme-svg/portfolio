# Welcome to my portfolio

My name is Guilherme, I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This repository aims to present my work as a designer.

I currently use:
 - [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics
 - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for image manipulation
 - [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) for collaborative work

I'm also studying web front end development, self-taught, and I try to help projects here on GitHub that demand something related to my skills.

In my design portfolio there are projects that I developed for external clients and some open source projects that I contribute.
